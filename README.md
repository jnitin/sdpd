# ApiCovid
Simple Android project to display global data distribution of covid-19. This application is still simple for testing the use of API, JSON, and display it.

There may be some * errors * since all processes are only handled by 2 (two) files: HttpHandler.java and MainActivity.java.

API: [https://covid19api.com/](https://covid19api.com/)
